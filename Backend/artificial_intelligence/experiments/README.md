# Experiments

This folder hosts self-contained prototypes that are not part of the supported backend runtime.

- `llm_agents/`: AutoGen- and MCP-based workflows that previously lived under `Backend/LargeLanguageModel`. They can be launched manually without affecting the layered backend, and nothing inside this directory is imported by the runtime packages.
